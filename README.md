# Background

I have a professional background in engineering, and volunteer experience in youth sports and being a first responder.   I am interested in my children and our community having opportunities to experience and learn about technology to enable them to make decisions about its place in their life.   Starting in 2019, I started to learn about applying computer literacy to kinder aged children.

## Created Resources

Resources I have created to help learn about cirriculum and communicate to others.

* [clever.com quick reference](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qtMP3LzquHEirfda712Foy8iN9O0yexxkMmN1kxkFEg/edit?usp=sharing) is a document I made to communicate how [SCUSD](https://www.scusd.edu/) students can use the clever.com login to access code.org and typing.com resources.
* [Bear Bot](https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/pLba-GGaMFFM-1QfC2RRLMQfEgiujXZG4f_BU7r1kss) is a code.com App project I created as a mock-up of what an App to control a robot could look like.

    * Okay, out of the box, this is not a begineer topic.  But if you are on a desktop computer, chances are python is [installed](https://www.dummies.com/programming/python/write-a-simple-program-in-python/) and one way to expose children to computers is to let them `type`.  Why not let them `type` at a `python console`? ![Python console as typing canvas](python_console_as_typing_canvas.png)
