# Lessons

## 1. Intro to software and code.org
* Intro
  * Recap circuits past lesson
  * circuits as **hardware**
  * introduce **software**
  * pick up a device (example: keyboard).  Is this **hardware** or **software**?
  * Ask if any of them play games or go to web sites?  for each one, reinforce **software**
  * Segway to code.org lesson: Circuits helped us learn how hardware works, how we are going to learn how software works with **code**
* code.org lesson
  * same clever.com login
  * follow link/icon for code.org
  * start cource with initial lesson https://studio.code.org/s/pre-express-2019 : Learn to Drag and Drop

## 2. Continuing software and code.org basics
* Intro
  * Reinforce **hardware** and **software**
  * if you wanted to make a robot, you would need hardware and software
  * what color lights to use for eyes?  **hardware**
  * what to say when they see me?  **software**
  * ask what they would design in their robot?  is that hardware or software?
  * ask thm what software feature they would design?  How would it great people?  what would it say?  What would it say if it sees the principle? teacher?  their parents?  What would it do if its power supply was low?
* code.org lesson

## 3. Peer Programming
* *special format*  Kinder + 2nd grade class buddies
* Intro
  * Introductions
  * Format intro
    * 1st half, kinders drive, 2nd graders observe/support (goal: get familir with how kinders login with clever, what they are learning on code.org)
    * 2nd half, 2nd graders drive, kinders navigate (peer programming)
  * Demo Apps: [Bear Bot](https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/pLba-GGaMFFM-1QfC2RRLMQfEgiujXZG4f_BU7r1kss)
* 1st half: kinders drive, self paced lesson
* [Peer Programming - code.org video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q)
* 2nd half
  * 2nd graders 'drive'
  * kinders: 'navigate'
  * Direct to use Artist or Sprite Lab
* Wrap-up
  * Retrospective
  
## 4. Continue software & code.org basics
* Intro
  * recap of what we are learning
  * why are we here?  what are we learning?
  * **hints** How do you direct the squirrel to get the acorn?   math: do you have to count?  directions: do you have to specify directions?  what do the arrows mean? 
* code.org lesson
